            <p class="diets-liner head-font">Why Are You Underweight/Overweight</p>
            <p class="diets-text main-font">There are 4 main factors affecting this:</p>
                <ul class="main-font">
                    <li class="head-font" style="margin-bottom: -10px; font-weight: 600">food choices</li>
                        <p>Your food may not appropiate with your recommended daily intake. You need to reduce/increase your portion.</p>
                    <li class="head-font" style="margin-bottom: -10px; font-weight: 600">activity level</li>
                        <p>If you're mostly active, you would need more food than the others, and contrary.</p>
                    <li class="head-font" style="margin-bottom: -10px; font-weight: 600">genetics</li>
                        <p>Your figure and weight may come from your body frame, or you may be suffered from some illness that prevent you from gaining/losing weight.</p>
                    <li class="head-font" style="margin-bottom: -10px; font-weight: 600">age</li>
                        <p>One of the primary reasons losing weight is harder to do as you grow older is due to a slowing metabolism, which is resulted from losing muscle.</p>
                </ul>
            <p class="main-font"> Basically, your total calories intake must higher than your calories out if you want to gain weight and lower if you want to lose weight. Here below are some tips for gaining/losing weight.</p>

            <div class="diets-heading head-font"><p>Gaining weight</p><img src="https://www.building-muscle101.com/images/skinny-to-big-muscular-main.jpg" width="550px">
            </div> 
                <ul class="main-font">
                    <li>
                    <strong><p class="head-font">eat more.</p></strong> Eat more calories than your body burns. How much depends on your metabolism and activity levels. But if you&#8217;re not gaining weight, you&#8217;re not eating enough.</li>
                    <li>
                    <strong><p class="head-font">eat more meals.</p></strong> Small meals are easier to eat than big ones. They don&#8217;t make you feel stuffed. Wake up earlier, eat breakfast, and then eat 3-4 more meals a day.</li>
                    <li>
                    <strong><p class="head-font">eat caloric dense foods.</p></strong> Food high in carbs and/or fats has more calories per serving. It takes less eating to create a caloric surplus. Bulk on pasta, dried fruits, nuts, etc.</li>
                    <li>
                    <strong><p class="head-font">eat more protein.</p></strong> Your muscles need protein to recover from your workouts and grow bigger. Eat a whole source of protein with each meal &#8211; meat, chicken, fish, eggs, etc</li>
                    <li>
                    <strong><p class="head-font">go liquid.</p></strong> Blended food digests more easily than solid food. Make weight gainer shakes by mixing oats, milk, banana, peanut butter and whey protein in your blender.</li>
                    <li>
                    <strong><p class="head-font">track calories.</p></strong> Skinny guys over-estimate how much they eat. They think they eat a lot but they don&#8217;t. Track your calorie intake to make sure you&#8217;re eating enough to gain weight.</li>
                    <li>
                    <strong><p class="head-font">lift heavy.</p></strong> You would want to gain muscle, not fat. Do free weight, compounds like Squats and Deadlifts instead. They trigger more <a href="prj-tips-exer.html#strength" style="color: green">strength</a> and muscle gains to gain weight.</li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                <strong><p class="head-font">drink water.</p></strong>Water not just keeps you hydrated but also increases metabolism, keeps you filled for long, flushes out toxins and prevents water retention.</li>
                <li>
                <strong><p class="head-font">reduce sugar/carb intake.</p></strong>If you canâ€™t give it up completely, at least try to gradually reduce it. Sugar is not just high in empty calories but also slows down your metabolism as per latest researches. It leads to obesity and heart-related issues.</li>
                <li>
                <strong><p class="head-font">eat fiber.</p></strong> Fibre not just flushes out cholesterol, keeps the gut clear but also keeps you satiated for long. It is very important to eat fibrous food when one wants to lose weight. Include psyllium husk, chia seeds, fruits and green vegetables in your diet</li>                 
                <li>
                <strong><p class="head-font">eat more protein.</p></strong>If you are not already doing it, add more proteins in your diet. Include dal, eggs, paneer and soya products on a daily basis. Proteins keep you satiated for long and prevent cravings.</li>                 
                <li>
                <strong><p class="head-font">chew your food.</p></strong>Chew your food 20-30 times. This is very important as it not just makes the food easily digestible but also reduces calorie intake. As per several researches, people who chew their food less, gain more weight.</li>
                <li>
                <strong><p class="head-font">doing exercises.</p></strong>Sport and exercises not only help you burn more calories, but also bring you a strong physics and better mood. 
                If you want to lose fat, you should try out <a href="prj-tips-exer.html#aerobic">aerobics/cardio</a> exercises, which burn fat real hard!</li>
